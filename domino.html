            <p class="dominoBio">Two years ago I adopted my dog, Domino. He is a 6 year old Pitbull/Rhodesian Ridgeback mix. His former owner raised him from a puppy but began neglecting him due to some personal issues. Her friend contacted me knowing I was interested in adopting a dog and the rest is history. I have embedded his Instagram profile below and if you'd like you can click <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dominotheridgebull/">HERE</a> to follow his adevntures!</p>
